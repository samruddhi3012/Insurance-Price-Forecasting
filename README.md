## üìç Objectives
Develop an optimized machine learning model to accurately predict insurance costs, enabling insurers to set fair premiums, improve risk assessment, and enhance customer satisfaction by providing personalized pricing based on individual risk factors.

## üìç Data

* Age: Age of the primary beneficiary.
* Sex: Gender of the primary beneficiary.
* BMI: Body mass index of the primary beneficiary.
* Children: Number of children the primary beneficiary has.
* Smoker: Whether the primary beneficiary smokes.
* Region: The primary beneficiary's residential area in the US.

## üìç Model Results
<!--* EDA
    1. After performing the EDA (from correlation section) it can be concluded that the children column has a low correlation to the target (charges).
    2. On the other hand for categorical features, from chi-squared test it is observed that sex and smoker have correlated to each other.
    3. From ANOVA test, it is seen that the column region is correlated to bmi.
    4. The features sex and region have low correlation with target (charges).

# Introduction
Insurance companies cover several health and property related costs. Medical expenditures, house and car damage, fire incidents, and financial losses can all be included among these outlays. Traditionally, computing insurance rates requires a lot of manual labor and effort to fit the ever more complicated data.

Insurance firms must have a consistent method to forecast healthcare costs and guarantee their profitability if they are to survive. Our aim is to design a machine learning model that forecasts the charges or payments made by the health insurance company, therefore guiding the rates and maintaining profitability.
